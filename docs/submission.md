### 📝 Test Plan (tests/test-plan.md)

# RAID Team Comprehensive Test Plan

**Project:** Book Store App — Web Application QA Project  
**Team Name:** RAID  
**Testing Period:** November 5, 2025 – November 18, 2025 (3 Weeks)

## Team Roles

| Role | Name | Core Responsibility |
|------|------|---------------------|
| Test Manager | Dennis | Planning, Schedule, Final Report Sign-off |
| Risk Analyst | Cindy | Risk-Based Prioritization, Defect Triage (Severity/Priority) |
| Test Executer | Deborah | Test Design, Execution, Evidence Capture |

## 1. Objective and Scope

### 1.1 Test Objective

The primary goal is to provide comprehensive quality assurance by verifying the application against all requirements and identifying defects in the following areas:

- **Functional Correctness:** Catalog, Cart/Checkout, Payments, Orders, Admin.
- **Accessibility (FR-X01):** Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA.
- **Performance (FR-X02):** Meet LCP and TTI budgets.
- **Security Hygiene (FR-X04):** Verify UGC sanitization and URL scheme validation.

### 1.2 In-Scope Features (Traceability to FR Codes)

| Component | Key Functional Requirements (FR) | Execution Priority |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Discovery | Search, Filter, Sort | Verify AND filter logic and stable sorting. |
| Checkout Flow | FR-O01, FR-O02 | Test all four steps (Shipping → Review → Payment → Confirmation). |
| Payments | FR-O03 | Paystack integration, currency validation (NGN/GHS/USD/ZAR). |
| Orders/Admin | FR-O04, FR-M03 | Order Status transitions (Pending → Paid → Delivered); Admin access guard. |

### 1.3 Out-of-Scope Items

Real backend services, real payment capture, multi-currency catalog display, and jurisdiction-specific tax/shipping logic.

## 2. Environments and Tools

| Category | Environment/Tool | Constraint/Target | Role Responsibility |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Project Management | Jira Cloud or GitHub Projects | Must use defined Components, Labels (intentional-defect, a11y, perf), and Workflow. | Dennis |
| Testing Environment | Local Repo with npm start | Requires pk_test_... key and REACT_APP_CURRENCY set (NGN, GHS, USD, or ZAR). | Deborah |
| Browsers/Devices | Latest 2 releases of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge | Must validate Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop breakpoints (FR-X03). | Deborah |
| Accessibility Tools | axe DevTools, WAVE, NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver | Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. | Deborah |
| Performance Tools | Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights | Measure LCP (≤2.5s/3s) and TTI (≤1s) (FR-X02). | Deborah |
| Admin Access | localStorage | Set app.user to { role: 'admin' } to access /admin. | Deborah |

## 3. Test Strategy and Risk Analysis

### 3.1 Test Strategy

The team will use a Risk-Based Testing (RBT) strategy, prioritizing execution based on the P1 items in the backlog and the inherent risk of the intentional defects.

### 3.2 Risk Prioritization (Cindy - Risk Analyst Focus)

| Risk Area | Impact / Requirement | Mitigation Strategy | Priority Target |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Intentional Defects | 10 known complex defects (e.g., Rounding ±0.01, Day 8 return, A11y modal) must be explicitly found and logged. | Dedicated Test Cases: Cindy must ensure specific test cases are created for all 10 defects, tracked with the intentional-defect label. | High |
| Checkout Flow Blockers | Failure in Payments (FR-O03) or the 4-step wizard (FR-O02) blocks the core transaction. | P1 Execution: Maximize test coverage on the /checkout route and Paystack integration; ensure proper error handling and status updates. | Critical |
| Security/UGC | Unsanitized UGC (Reviews/Q&A) could allow XSS attacks (FR-S01). | Negative Testing: Test input fields with scripts and non-whitelisted URL schemes (javascript:) to verify sanitation is enforced. | High |

## 4. Project Schedule and Criteria

### 4.1 Weekly Milestones

| Week | Due Date | Key Activities | Required Deliverables |
|------|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Week 1 | Nov 5 (Wednesday) | Kickoff, Jira/Board Setup, Environment check. | Signed-off Test Plan. |
| Week 2 | Nov 11 (Tuesday) | Test Case Design, P1 Execution, Defect Triage. | Draft Test Cases (tests/test-cases.md), Interim defect log. |
| Week 3 | Nov 18 (Tuesday) | Full Execution, Defect re-testing, Final Report preparation. | Final Submission (Report, Video link, Board Exports). |

### 4.2 Entry and Exit Criteria

| Criteria Type | Condition |
|---------------|-----------|
| Entry Criteria (Execution Start) | The app runs locally; Jira/GitHub Projects board is configured and shared; Test Plan is signed off. |
| Exit Criteria (Completion / Submission) | Full test execution coverage of P1 items achieved; All defects are logged with full details and evidence; All final artifacts prepared. |

## 5. Required Deliverables and Templates
